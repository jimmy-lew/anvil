Welcome to **Docus**, a fully integrated documentation solution built with [Nuxt UI](https://ui.nuxt.com).

## What is Docus?

Docus is a theme based on the [UI documentation template](https://docs-template.nuxt.dev/). While the visual style comes ready out of the box, your focus should be on writing content using the Markdown and [MDC syntax](https://content.nuxt.com/docs/files/markdown#mdc-syntax) provided by [Nuxt Content](https://content.nuxt.com).

We use this theme across all our Nuxt module documentations, including:
